## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/MGxCoder/operatorOverloadingCPP.git 
   ```

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. You can use g++ as follows:

   ```bash
   g++ operatorOverloadingCPP.cpp -o operatorOverloadingCPP
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./operatorOverloadingCPP
   ```

## Usage

1. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two complex numbers. For each complex number, you need to enter the real and imaginary parts separately.

2. The program will then display the entered complex numbers.

3. It will calculate the sum and difference of the two complex numbers and display the results.

4. The results will be shown in the format "RealPart + ImaginaryParti".
